        font What is it and how does it work?
    p.fontsize-base.u-marginbottom-60
      font
        font JVN is an online platform that aims to bring together CAMPAIGN CREATORS and SUPPORTERS, with the objective of COLLECTIVE COLLECTION OF FUNDS ("crowd funding"), to make feasible CAMPAIGNS.
        font JVN allows a CAMPAIGN CREATOR to present a CAMPAIGN idea and raise funds from SUPPORTERS interested in contributing to this CAMPAIGN.
        font CAMPAIGN CREATORS will also be able to offer the SUPPORTERS rewards, which will be defined by the CAMPAIGN CREATOR in each of these CAMPAIGNS.
        font JVN gathers the amounts disbursed by the SUPPORTERS destined to each of these CAMPAIGNS until the final deadline determined by the respective CAMPAIGN CREATORS.
      br/
      font
        font
          | When a CAMPAIGN ALL OR NOTHING reaches or exceeds the stipulated amount for its feasibility, within the term stipulated in the CAMPAIGN, the total amount raised of the SUPPORTERS will be available to be redeemed by the CREATOR OF THE CAMPAIGN, discounting the 5% + online payment charges.
        font In contrast, if a CAMPAIGN ALL OR NOTHING does not reach the requested amount, it will not be financed and JVN will provide the REIMBURSEMENT of the amounts paid.
        font For amounts paid by credit card, REFUND will be made on the next invoice or subsequent invoice of the credit card.
        font If the payment was made through a bank slip, the REFUND will be made through deposit into the bank account indicated by the SUPPORTER, as requested by JVN.
        font If the bank account is not provided for REFUND, JVN will keep the amounts available for REFUND for a maximum period of 90 days, as detailed in the item "Fees and Payments" below.

        font What is and how JVN Flex works
    p.fontsize-base.u-marginbottom-60
      font
        font In this modality, the objective of CAMPAIGN CREATORS continues being the collective financing, but now, with more flexibility.
      br/
      font
        font Unlike JVN ALL or NOTHING, by choosing JVN FLEX the CAMPAIGN CREATOR will be able to carry out longer lasting campaigns.
        font To be created, the FLEX CAMPAIGN does not need a closing date forecast.
        font The campaign may be open for up to 365 days from the date of publication of the CAMPAIGN.
      br/
      font
        font Unlike JVN ALL or NOTHING, the CAMPAIGN CREATOR receives everything he has been able to collect until the moment the FLEX CAMPAIGN is closed, provided that the amount collected exceeds the amount required by JVN as a minimum transfer.
      br/
      font
        font In JVN FLEX, in addition, the SUPPORTER may receive rewards, as long as this possibility is clear in the FLEX CAMPAIGN, but the SUPPORTER will not receive, in any event, the amounts destined for that CAMPAIGN, except in specific cases at JVN's discretion.
