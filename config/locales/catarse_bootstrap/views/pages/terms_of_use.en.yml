CAMPAIGN CREATORS will also be able to offer the SUPPORTERS rewards, which will be defined by the CAMPAIGN CREATOR in each of these CAMPAIGN. The Grasruts collects the amounts disbursed by the SUPPORTERS destined to each of these CAMPAIGN until the final deadline determined by the respective CAMPAIGN CREATORS.


          When a CAMPAIGN EVERYTHING OR NOTHING reaches or exceeds the amount stipulated for its feasibility, within the period stipulated in the CAMPAIGN, the total amount raised of the SUPPORTERS will be available to be redeemed by the CREATOR OF THE CAMPAIGN, discounting the percentage due to the Grasruts, provided that the amount collected exceeds the amount required by the Grasruts as a minimum transfer.

          In Grasruts FLEX, in addition, the SUPPORTER may receive rewards, provided that this possibility is clear in the FLEX CAMPAIGN, but the SUPPORTER shall not in any case receive the amounts intended for that CAMPAIGN except in specific cases at the discretion of the Grasruts.
