        fund:
          title: "Collective Financing or Crowdfunding?"
          text: "Two names for the same practice in which people contribute small sums of money to make campaign viable. Crowd is crowd in English, funding, funding. Crowdfunding is funding by the crowd."
        allornothing:
          title: "Why all or nothing?"
          text_html: "We believe in the all or nothing model because, in addition to the campaigns collecting more, this is one way to ensure that a campaign will only happen if it can be delivered as it has been described and promised to the supporters."
        services:
          title: "Our services"
          text: "The Grasruts provides support for site users and makes it possible for campaign to capture resources quickly and easily using the internet. Anyone over the age of 18 (or younger, but with a legal representative) can use our services and run a crowdfunding campaign as long as the campaign meets our selection criteria."
        fees:
          title: "How we stand"
          text: "We charge 13% of the total value of campaign that have met or exceeded the collection goal. We get about 9% and 4% is passed on to Paid.me, the payment method used in the Grasruts. Campaigns that did not reach the goal do not have any cost and all the supporters receive the money back."
        work:
          title: "We work with purpose and love."
          text: "The Grasruts is independent, open-source, and love-built. Our passion is to build an environment where more and more campaign can come to life. Today we are a team of 23 people very willing to help distribute more resources to campaign spread throughout Brazil."
      staff: "These are some of us waiting for you to take a campaign from paper..."
